# testimonials-grid-section-frontend-mentor-challenge
This is my implementation of the Frontend Mentor "Testimonials Grid Section", which is the final challenge of the Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course on freecodecamp.org YouTube channel.

* <b> images </b> folder contains the images used in the built testimonials grid section.
* <b> instructions </b> folder contains the style guide given and the design reference for the challenge.
* <b> README.md </b> contains the short description of this project.
* <b> index.html </b> is the HTML file that contains the source code.
* <b> style.css </b> is the CSS file that contains most of the file's styles.

This code can also be viewed in a computer by clicking the HTML file, given that the user has downloaded all of the files and located it in a single folder.
